# DispatchAI ‚Äì Complete MVP Implementation Roadmap

_Created: 2025-09-16_
_Last Updated: 2025-10-06_
_Status: Phase 3 Complete - Phase 4 In Progress_

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

This roadmap defines the complete path from current state (single-tenant webhook ingestion) to a fully multi-tenant GitHub issue triaging platform with authentication, repository management, and cross-repo analytics.

**Core Value Proposition:** Allow any GitHub user to sign in, connect repositories (their own or public ones), automatically classify issues using LLMs, and provide intelligent filtering/search across all their connected repositories.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Current State Assessment

‚úÖ **Completed (Phases 1-3 Core):**
- Event-driven microservices (ingress ‚Üí kafka ‚Üí classifier ‚Üí gateway ‚Üí dashboard)
- LLM-powered issue classification with confidence scoring
- Embeddings for similarity search (pgvector)
- Real-time streaming to React dashboard with JWT-authenticated WebSocket
- Human-in-the-loop editing capability
- **‚úÖ Multi-tenancy and user management**
- **‚úÖ Repository connection workflow (user repos + organizations)**
- **‚úÖ Public/private dashboard visibility controls**
- **‚úÖ Production-ready authentication flow (GitHub OAuth + JWT)**
- **‚úÖ Repository-level access control for WebSocket and API endpoints**

üîÑ **What needs enhancement (Phase 3 UI + Phase 4):**
- Repository switcher/navigation UI components
- Repository grouping and filtering in dashboard
- Cross-repository analytics and search
- Public dashboard sharing features (social metadata, CTAs)
- Repository health scoring and insights

## üìÖ Recent Updates (2025-10-06)

### Phase 3 Multi-Tenant Security - Core Implementation Complete

**‚úÖ Completed Features:**

1. **JWT-Authenticated WebSocket Connections**
   - WebSocket endpoint now verifies JWT tokens before accepting connections
   - User context tracked for each WebSocket connection
   - Automatic reconnection when user token changes (login/logout)
   - Support for both authenticated and public (unauthenticated) connections

2. **Repository-Based Access Control**
   - Kafka message broadcasting filters by user's repository access permissions
   - Real-time database queries verify user permissions before broadcasting
   - Private repositories remain isolated to authorized users only
   - WebSocket clients only receive updates for repositories they have access to

3. **Public Dashboard API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/public/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` - View public repository issues (no auth)
   - `GET /api/public/repos/{owner}/{repo}/stats` - View public repository statistics (no auth)
   - Public endpoints validate `is_public_dashboard` flag before allowing access
   - Proper 404 responses for non-public or non-existent repositories

4. **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation**
   - All API endpoints filter data by user's connected repositories
   - Issue streams, statistics, and individual issue access all respect user permissions
   - Repository-level access checks prevent cross-user data leaks

**üîÑ Remaining Phase 3 Work:**
- UI components for repository switching/filtering
- Enhanced issue display with repository grouping
- Social sharing metadata for public dashboards
- Repository health indicators and sync status displays

**Commit:** `9cf168d` - feat: implement multi-tenant WebSocket security with JWT verification and repository-based access control

## üîß Technical Architecture Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
- **Keep dedicated auth microservice** - maintains clean boundaries, easy to swap providers later
- **GitHub OAuth as sole IdP** - zero cost, users already have accounts
- **JWT with refresh tokens** - stateless verification, secure session management
- **No external auth services** - maintains cost control and simplicity

### Multi-Tenancy Model
- **Shared repository table** - prevents duplication across users
- **User-repository join table** - flexible many-to-many relationships
- **Role-based access** - extensible for future features
- **Repository-level visibility controls** - supports both public and private dashboards

### Data Architecture
- **Preserve existing event-driven flow** - minimal changes to working system
- **Extend with user context** - add user_id to relevant events
- **Maintain embedding-based search** - leverage existing pgvector investment
- **Cross-repository indexing** - enable global search and analytics

## üö® Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **GitHub access tokens stored in plain text** | **Critical** | **High** | **IMMEDIATE: Implement proper encryption with cryptography library** |
| GitHub API rate limits | High | Medium | Implement intelligent caching, stagger bulk imports |
| Database migration issues | High | Low | Thorough testing in dev, backup procedures |
| JWT secret compromise | High | Low | Key rotation procedures, short token lifetimes |
| User data privacy concerns | Medium | Medium | Clear privacy policy, minimal data collection |
| Scale beyond single VPS | Medium | High | Design for horizontal scaling from start |
