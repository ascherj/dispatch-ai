# DispatchAI ‚Äì Complete MVP Implementation Roadmap

_Created: 2025-09-16_
_Status: Planning_

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

This roadmap defines the complete path from current state (single-tenant webhook ingestion) to a fully multi-tenant GitHub issue triaging platform with authentication, repository management, and cross-repo analytics.

**Core Value Proposition:** Allow any GitHub user to sign in, connect repositories (their own or public ones), automatically classify issues using LLMs, and provide intelligent filtering/search across all their connected repositories.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Current State Assessment

‚úÖ **What we have:**
- Event-driven microservices (ingress ‚Üí kafka ‚Üí classifier ‚Üí gateway ‚Üí dashboard)
- LLM-powered issue classification with confidence scoring
- Embeddings for similarity search (pgvector)
- Real-time streaming to React dashboard
- Human-in-the-loop editing capability
- Basic auth service foundation already created

üîÑ **What needs enhancement:**
- Multi-tenancy and user management
- Repository connection workflow
- Public/private dashboard visibility controls
- Cross-repository filtering and search
- Production-ready authentication flow

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal:** Enable secure GitHub OAuth login with persistent sessions

#### 1.1 Environment Setup
- [ ] Configure GitHub OAuth App credentials
- [ ] Add environment variables: `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `JWT_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- [ ] Update docker-compose with auth service secrets
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Implement proper token encryption in storage.py (currently storing GitHub tokens in plain text)

#### 1.2 Auth Service Enhancement
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Replace placeholder encryption methods with proper encryption using `cryptography` library
- [ ] Integrate GitHub OAuth flow in existing `auth` service
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation (15-min access + 7-day refresh)
- [ ] Create user registration/login endpoints
- [ ] Add token verification middleware for other services

#### 1.3 Database Schema
```sql
-- Core authentication tables
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    github_id INTEGER UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    github_login VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    avatar_url TEXT,
    email VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Repository registry (global, shared across users)
CREATE TABLE repositories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    github_repo_id BIGINT UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- GitHub's immutable repo ID
    owner VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    private BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    is_public_dashboard BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, -- Allow unauthenticated access
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    UNIQUE(owner, name)
);

-- Many-to-many: users can connect to multiple repos
CREATE TABLE user_repositories (
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
    repo_id INTEGER REFERENCES repositories(id),
    role VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'viewer', -- 'owner', 'viewer'
    can_write BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    added_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (user_id, repo_id)
);
```

#### 1.4 Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update React dashboard with AuthContext
- [ ] Add login/logout UI components

### Phase 3: Multi-Tenant Dashboard (Week 3)
**Goal:** Secure, user-specific dashboards with proper visibility controls

#### 3.1 Access Control Implementation
- [ ] Add JWT verification to gateway websocket connections
- [ ] Filter issue streams based on user's connected repositories

#### 3.4 Public Dashboard Sharing
- [ ] Create shareable public URLs for public repositories
- [ ] Add social sharing metadata (OpenGraph, Twitter cards)
- [ ] Implement view-only mode for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Add "Connect this repository" CTA for logged-out users

**Success Criteria:** Users see only their connected repositories, public dashboards are accessible without auth, private ones require proper permissions

### Phase 4: Cross-Repository Analytics (Week 4)
**Goal:** Powerful filtering and search across all connected repositories

#### 4.1 Enhanced Filtering System
- [ ] Add cross-repository tag filtering

## üîß Technical Architecture Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
- **Keep dedicated auth microservice** - maintains clean boundaries, easy to swap providers later
- **GitHub OAuth as sole IdP** - zero cost, users already have accounts
- **JWT with refresh tokens** - stateless verification, secure session management
- **No external auth services** - maintains cost control and simplicity

### Multi-Tenancy Model
- **Shared repository table** - prevents duplication across users
- **User-repository join table** - flexible many-to-many relationships
- **Role-based access** - extensible for future features
- **Repository-level visibility controls** - supports both public and private dashboards

### Data Architecture
- **Preserve existing event-driven flow** - minimal changes to working system
- **Extend with user context** - add user_id to relevant events
- **Maintain embedding-based search** - leverage existing pgvector investment
- **Cross-repository indexing** - enable global search and analytics

## üö® Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| **GitHub access tokens stored in plain text** | **Critical** | **High** | **IMMEDIATE: Implement proper encryption with cryptography library** |
| GitHub API rate limits | High | Medium | Implement intelligent caching, stagger bulk imports |
| Database migration issues | High | Low | Thorough testing in dev, backup procedures |
| JWT secret compromise | High | Low | Key rotation procedures, short token lifetimes |
| User data privacy concerns | Medium | Medium | Clear privacy policy, minimal data collection |
| Scale beyond single VPS | Medium | High | Design for horizontal scaling from start |
